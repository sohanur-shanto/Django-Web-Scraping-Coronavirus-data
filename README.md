# Django-Web-Scraping-Coronavirus-data

Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.

For some reason, I needed some data related to coronavirus. I wanted to build a server with those statistics. So I used beautifulsoup for this particular event and it worked really well. I can fetch updated data from any website using this.
